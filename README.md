# Stock Analysis - Module 2 : VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project

### Background
Steve's parents are interested in 'Green' or enviromentally friendly Stocks. We've created a vba code to review multiple tickers over multiple years using a AllStockAnalysis module with VBA code. However, the code is no efficient and can be improved. This way if Steve would like to review a large number of stocks, the module will use less memory. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to use more efficient code. In using less steps and more abstract logic, code can become more efficient, use less memory, and decrease run time.
